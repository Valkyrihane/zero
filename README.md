# Install

Zero is available on the Visual Studio Code marketplace, and can be easily installed.

- Open extension menu
- Search for __"Zero Theme"__
- Install
- Do not forget to activate

I would strongly advise you to also install the [Chalice](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=artlaman.chalice-icon-theme) icon theme, that fits really well with Zero.
